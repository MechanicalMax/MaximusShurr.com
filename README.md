## Overview

This repository contains the complete source code for my personal portfolio.

This site is my digital home base, designed to showcase my journey as a full-stack developer and mechanical engineer. It's built to be a high-velocity conversion engine that reflects my "Cofounder" brand: I don't just write code; I ship complete, value-driven products.

### ⚡️ Current Status: Milestone 1 (MVP for 16Tech Ignition Speaking Event)

This project is under active development.

The current live version (V1) is a professional "digital business card" launched specifically for the 16Tech Ignition collegiate founder pitch.

The V1 site features:

- A complete, static homepage with my full narrative and project portfolio.
- A high-conversion `/book` page funneling all interest to my calendar.
- A simple `/resume` page with my PDF resume.

To maximize lead capture from this event, all project tiles temporarily point to the `/book` page. Dynamic case study pages are the next milestone.

## Project Roadmap

- ✅ **Milestone 1: The "24-Hour MVP"**

  - Launch a static, professional landing page.

  - Implement a high-conversion `/book` page funnel.

  - (Target: 16Tech Ignition Pitch)

- ➡️ **Milestone 2: The "First Dynamic Slice"**

  - Build the dynamic `[slug]` page template for case studies.

  - Content: Ship the first P1 Case Study (video + `.mdx` file).

  - Tech: Update the homepage to link the first tile to its case study page.

  - Launch the `/resume` utility page.

- 📅 **Milestone 3: The "Rollout"**

  - Iteratively create and ship all P1, P2, and P3 case studies (videos + `.mdx` content).

  - The site will come to life dynamically as each case study is completed.

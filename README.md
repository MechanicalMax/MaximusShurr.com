## Overview

This repository contains the complete source code for my personal portfolio and professional platform.

This site serves as my digital headquarters, showcasing my unique position as both a Mechanical Engineer and Full-Stack Developer. It's designed as a high-conversion platform that reflects my core value proposition: **I engineer realities by connecting the digital and physical worlds**. I don't just write code—I translate physical operations into scalable digital solutions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MechanicalMax/MaximusShurr.com.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Next.js app directory**
   ```bash
   cd MaximusShurr.com/next-web-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site locally.

### Running Tests

```bash
cd next-web-app
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

The test suite includes property-based tests using fast-check to verify:
- Case study discovery and parsing
- Frontmatter validation and deprecated field removal
- Slug-to-route mapping
- Media carousel generation and filtering
- Caption generation consistency
- Social proof detection accuracy
- Homepage thumbnail and icon auto-discovery
- Invalid input handling and security validation

### Building for Production

```bash
cd next-web-app
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This generates static HTML for all pages, including all 12 case study routes.

## Flexible Media Carousel System

The site features an automatic media carousel system that generates interactive carousels from asset folders without manual configuration. This follows a "what you see is what you get" principle where folder contents directly determine carousel behavior.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Discovery**: The system scans `public/case-study/[slug]/` folders for media files
2. **Smart Filtering**: Includes all `.webp` and `.webm` files while excluding `icon.webp` from carousels
3. **Intelligent Ordering**: Applies hierarchy - YouTube → Thumbnail → Videos (A-Z) → Images (A-Z)
4. **Caption Generation**: Converts filenames to human-readable captions (hyphens become spaces)
5. **Social Proof Detection**: Automatically detects icons and YouTube videos for UI badges
6. **Homepage Integration**: Thumbnails and social proof icons are automatically sourced from media folders

### Media Asset Structure

```
public/case-study/[slug]/
├── thumbnail.webp      # Required - Homepage card thumbnail & carousel slide #2
├── icon.webp          # Optional - Homepage social proof badge (excluded from carousel)
├── Circuit-Design.webp # Media asset - becomes carousel slide
├── Demo-Day.webm      # Video asset - becomes carousel slide
└── Final-Product.webp # Media asset - becomes carousel slide
```

**Key Changes from Previous System:**
- ✅ **Thumbnails**: Now auto-discovered from `thumbnail.webp` in media folders (no more `cover_image` frontmatter)
- ✅ **Social Proof Icons**: Now auto-discovered from `icon.webp` in media folders (no more centralized `/logos/` directory)
- ✅ **Homepage Integration**: Homepage tiles automatically use discovered thumbnails and icons
- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: No manual path specification needed in frontmatter

### Slide Hierarchy

The carousel automatically orders slides according to this hierarchy:

1. **YouTube Embed** (if `cover_video_url` exists in frontmatter) - Slide #1
2. **Thumbnail** (`thumbnail.webp`) - Slide #2 (or #1 if no YouTube)
3. **Videos** (all `.webm` files) - Alphabetically sorted
4. **Images** (all `.webp` files except `thumbnail.webp` and `icon.webp`) - Alphabetically sorted

### Inline Media References

Within your MDX content, you can reference any carousel asset using the `InlineImage` component:

```jsx
<InlineImage filename="Circuit-Design.webp" alt="Circuit board layout" />
```

This automatically resolves to the current case study's asset folder and applies Next.js image optimization.

### Video Features

Videos in the carousel automatically include:
- Autoplay (muted for user experience)
- Loop playback
- Responsive sizing
- Fallback handling for loading failures

## Adding New Case Studies

Case studies are authored as MDX files in `next-web-app/case_studies/`. Each file includes YAML frontmatter for metadata and Markdown content for the narrative.

### File Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case: `project-name.mdx`
- The filename (without `.mdx`) becomes the URL slug: `/case-study/project-name`

### Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
---
project_title: "Your Project Title"
one_liner: "A compelling one-sentence description"
project_type: "Web App | Mobile App | Hardware | Hybrid"
status: "Complete | In Progress | Ongoing"
live_url: "https://example.com" # or null
repo_url: "https://github.com/..." # or null
cover_video_url: "https://youtube.com/..." # or null
tech_stack: ["Product Development", "CAD/Sim", "Programming", "React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL"]
start_date: "Jan 2025"
end_date: "Jul 2025" # or null for ongoing
testimonial:
  text: "Quote from client or manager"
  author: "John Doe"
  role: "CEO, Company Name"
# or testimonial: null
---
```

**Tech Stack Categories:**
The `tech_stack` array now includes high-level skill categories at the beginning, followed by specific technologies:

- **High-Level Categories**: "Product Development", "R&D Engineering", "Systems Integration", "CAD/Sim", "Programming", "Strategy & Branding", "Rapid Prototyping"
- **Specific Technologies**: "React", "Python", "SolidWorks", "3D Printing", etc.

This dual-level approach enables both broad skill-based filtering and detailed technology discovery.

**Note:** The `cover_image` field has been removed from frontmatter. Thumbnails are now automatically discovered from `thumbnail.webp` files in the corresponding `/case-study/[slug]/` media folder. Social proof logos are also automatically discovered from `icon.webp` files in the same folders.

### Content Sections

After the frontmatter, structure your case study with these recommended sections:

```markdown
### Product Strategy: The "Business Thinking"

Explain the strategic approach and business context...

### The Problem

Describe the challenge or opportunity...

### The Build

Detail the technical implementation...

### The Outcome

Share results, metrics, and impact...
```

### Media Asset Optimization (Required)
All media **must be optimized before committing.**

This project includes a dedicated npm script that automatically optimizes all case study media in-place, converting files to web-ready formats while preserving human-readable filenames.

#### Run the optimizer
```
npm run optimize-case-study-assets
```

#### What the script does
- Converts images → WebP
- Converts videos → WebM (VP9)
- Strips original file extensions from output names
  - Example: Melodi Piano Project.PNG → Melodi Piano Project.webp
- Enforces a maximum width (1920px)
- Removes audio tracks from videos
- Writes optimized files in the same directory as the originals
- Leaves raw source files untouched (but ignored by Git)

#### Git policy
- ✅ Optimized .webp / .webm files are committed
- ❌ Raw .png, .jpg, .mov, .mp4 files are ignored
- Raw assets may exist locally but are never checked into the repository

This ensures:
- Fast load times
- Small repository size
- Deterministic, repeatable media processing

The system automatically:
- Generates the case study page at `/case-study/[slug]`
- Creates a homepage tile with cover image and metadata
- Sorts projects by end date (most recent first)
- Handles SEO metadata and social media previews

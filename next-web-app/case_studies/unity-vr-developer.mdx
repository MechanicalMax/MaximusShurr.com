### Product Strategy: The "Business Thinking"

My role at the Purdue Envision Center was to build a virtual lab for students to practice dangerous procedures—specifically, sampling airborne bacteria—without the physical risks.

My technical strategy was **"Simulated Precision."** In a real lab, a mistake costs money or safety. In VR, it costs nothing. I focused on building realistic core mechanics (like operating a pipette) so the muscle memory would transfer to the real world.

However, this role also shaped my **Professional Strategy**. I realized that I thrive in high-velocity, high-stakes environments. While the center did important work, the pace felt more like a campus job than a product team. I learned that for me to create the "joy and wonder" I aim for, I need to be surrounded by people who are as obsessed with the outcome as I am.

### The Problem

We needed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and physical skill.

- **The Safety Gap:** Training students to handle biohazards is dangerous and expensive.

- **The Feedback Loop:** In a physical lab, you might not know you contaminated a sample until days later. In VR, we needed to provide instant visual feedback (e.g., color changes) to correct behavior in real-time.

- **The Skill Gap (Personal):** I was still refining my own coding abilities. I needed a project that forced me to level up my C# and software architecture skills beyond simple scripts.

### The Build

I worked as a **Unity C# Developer** within a student team.

- **Core Mechanics:**

    - I programmed the interaction logic for the virtual pipette, simulating the fluid transfer from source to agar plate.

    - I implemented the game states to track user progress and errors, ensuring the simulation accurately reflected lab protocols.

- **Requirements Gathering:**

    - I met with clients to define stakeholder software requirements, translating vague educational goals into concrete technical deliverables.

    - I utilized **Asana** and **Microsoft Teams** to document project progress, learning the importance of clear communication in remote/hybrid workflows.

### The Outcome

This experience was a crucial stepping stone in my career.

- **Technical Contribution**: I successfully contributed to the core mechanics of a functional VR prototype that is used to train students safely.

- **Self-Discovery**: I realized that I wasn't just looking for a "job"; I was **looking for a mission**. I chose to leave this role not because the work wasn't good, but because I knew I needed a more challenging, collaborative environment to reach my full potential.

- **The "Why"**: It taught me that **environment is everything**. To build world-class products, you need to be in a world-class team. This realization drove me to seek out my subsequent roles at LeafSpec and Corteva, where I could contribute to "huge projects" with tangible impact.

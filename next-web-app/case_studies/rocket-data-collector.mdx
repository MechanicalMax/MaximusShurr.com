### Product Strategy: The "Business Thinking"

This project started with a single question. My aerospace teacher asked the class, rhetorically, if it was possible to use an Arduino to track a rocket's flight path. Most students heard a comment; I heard a challenge.

My strategy was **"Self-Directed Scale."** I realized that breadboards and wires wouldn't survive the G-force of a launch—we needed professional hardware. But I also knew I couldn't do it alone. I decided to master the skills first (PCB design, C++) and then act as the **Technical Lead**, teaching my friends how to solder and assemble the boards so we could launch as a team.

### The Problem

We needed to capture high-fidelity data in a high-stress environment.

- **The Hardware Constraint:** Standard Arduino kits are bulky and fragile. A model rocket experiences violent acceleration and vibration that would rip standard wiring apart.

- **The Data Challenge:** We needed to capture acceleration, gyroscopic data, temperature, and pressure simultaneously, writing it to memory fast enough (10Hz) to reconstruct the flight path later.

- **The Knowledge Gap:** None of us knew how to design a Printed Circuit Board (PCB).

### The Build

I spent months outside of class teaching myself electrical engineering principles to build a custom solution.

- **Custom PCB Architecture:**

    - I designed a custom motherboard that integrated an **Arduino microcontroller** with an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, and temperature sensor.

    - I engineered the board to fit precisely within the rocket's fuselage, ensuring the parachute could still deploy safely.

- **Firmware Engineering:**

    - I wrote the firmware in **C++**, optimizing the code to poll all sensors **10 times a second** and write the telemetry to an onboard SD card without latency.

- **Team Leadership:**

    - Once I validated the prototype, I didn't just build the rest myself. I set up a "soldering station" and taught two other students how to assemble the components. I transformed from a solo engineer into a manufacturing lead, ensuring quality control across our small fleet.

### The Outcome

This was my first long-term engineering success.

- **Mission Success:** The PCB survived the launch and parachute deployment, successfully recording the flight trajectory.

- **Data Validation:** We recovered the SD card and analyzed the flight path, proving that the rhetorical question had a very real answer.

- **Public Recognition:** Featured in a newspaper article highlighting the rocket's successful flight, the development of the custom electronics, and the project's educational impact on the classroom.

- **The "Why"**: This project taught me that engineering is a team sport. The joy wasn't just in the data; it was in seeing my friends successfully solder their first board and watching our collective hard work soar into the sky.

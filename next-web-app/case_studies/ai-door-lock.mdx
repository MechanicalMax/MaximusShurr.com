### Product Strategy: The "Business Thinking"

Sometimes, the best way to master a new technology is to apply it to a trivial problem. My bedroom door didn't have a lock, and my younger brother had a habit of barging in.

I could have bought a $10 latch. Instead, I saw an opportunity to conduct a masterclass in **Generative Design**.

My strategy was **"Optimization over Adequacy."** I didn't want a lock that *just* worked; I wanted a lock that was mathematically perfect. I used this project to teach myself how to use AI to dictate material placement, ensuring the part was as strong and lightweight as possible. It was a practice run for the complex structural challenges I would later face in my professional career.

### The Problem

I needed privacy, but physics was in the way.

- **The Structural Failure:** Previous iterations of my 3D-printed locks kept snapping. The shear force exerted by the metal doorframe was too high for standard PLA plastic layers.

- **The "User" Constraint:** My brother. He was persistent. If the lock wasn't robust, he would force the handle until something broke.

- **The Design Challenge:** The lock had to wedge between the door, the frame, and the handle without requiring permanent installation (no drilling holes).

### The Build

I treated this winter break project like a defense contract.

- **Defining the Load:** I calculated the maximum force a person could exert on the handle and the reaction forces from the doorframe.

- **Generative Design (The "AI" Twist):**

    - Instead of drawing the shape myself, I defined the "keep-in" and "keep-out" zones in **Fusion 360**.

    - I let the AI iterate through thousands of geometries to "grow" the part, placing material only where the stress lines required it. This resulted in an organic, alien-looking structure that no human would intuitively design.

- **Validation:**

    - I ran **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** simulations to verify the safety factor. The data showed that the metal door handle would technically fail *before* my plastic lock did.

### The Outcome

What started as a sibling rivalry ended as a technical triumph. Aiden, if you are reading this, I promise I just wanted to do an engineering project, not keep the door locked forever ;).

- **Third Time's the Charm:** The first two human-designed iterations broke. The third, AI-generated iteration is still holding strong today.

- **Educational Value:** I documented the entire process on YouTube, sharing my "failure-to-success" journey with the engineering community.

- **The "Why":** I realized halfway through that I wasn't really trying to keep my brother out anymore; I was just obsessed with the iteration process. It proved that engineering is most fun when you take a silly problem seriously. (Sorry Aiden!)

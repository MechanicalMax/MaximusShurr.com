### Product Strategy: The "Constraint Innovation"

**The Challenge:** Build a combat-ready robot in **72 hours** as a **solo engineer**, competing against 4-person teams with weeks of lead time.

**The Strategy:** *Simulation-First, Parallel Execution.*
I couldn't afford the traditional "Design → Build → Test" waterfall. I implemented a **Just-In-Time (JIT)** workflow:
* **Phase 1 (Simulation):** used Python to derive torque requirements before opening CAD.
* **Phase 2 (Parallel Fab):** Designed the electronics housing *while* the chassis was printing.
* **Phase 3 (Edge Logic):** Wrote C++ kinematic mixing algorithms that ran locally on the ESP32 to eliminate Wi-Fi latency.

### The Problem

I faced a "David vs. Goliath" scenario defined by three hard constraints:

1.  **The Resource Gap:** I was a solo engineer competing against "Standard Competitor Units" (4 engineers).
2.  **The Physics Constraint:** My chassis was PLA (Plastic). Competitors used metal saw blades. I had to design for **agility over durability**.
3.  **The Time Limit:** A 72-hour hard stop. No extensions. No do-overs.

### The Build

I treated this as a 43-hour active engineering sprint, assuming ownership of the full technical stack.

**1. Python-Driven Kinematics (The "No-Guessing" Rule)**
Most students guessed their lever lengths. I calculated mine.
* I wrote a **Python Jupyter Notebook** to map the "Design Space" of the flipper mechanism.
* **The Optimization:** The simulation identified that a **4.5cm lever arm** provided the local maximum for torque (1.33kg output), ensuring I could lift opponents without stalling the servo.
* *Result:* I skipped the "trial and error" phase entirely. The first prototype worked.

**2. Top-Down CAD Architecture (PTC Creo)**
To support the JIT manufacturing, I used a **"Master Model" methodology**.
* I created a "Skeleton Model" defining the bounding box and COTS component locations.
* All structural parts referenced this skeleton. If I moved the battery in the master sketch, the chassis mounts updated automatically, preventing assembly conflicts during the rush.

**3. IoT Edge Computing**
I didn't just remote-control the bot; I programmed it to drive itself.
* **Architecture:** Used an **ESP32** as an intelligent edge node.
* **Kinematic Mixing:** The differential drive logic (Left = Y + X, Right = Y - X) ran *on the chip*, not the phone. This meant that even if the Wi-Fi stuttered, the motor control remained smooth.

### The Outcome

**The Victory:**
Despite the resource asymmetry, **BOTIMUS won the Division Championship**.
* **Tactical Advantage:** The "Combat Cockpit" UX allowed me to maneuver while firing the weapon blindly, a feature competitors lacked.
* **Kinematic Superiority:** The 4.5cm lever arm (derived from Python) successfully pinned two opponents, validating the math.

**The Failure (And the Lesson):**
In the Grand Finals, reality caught up. A Kinetic Energy Weapon (Rotary Saw) sheared the left motor mount.
* **Root Cause:** My "Monocoque" printing strategy (Strong Skin / Weak Core) was optimized for blunt force, not shear force. The saw bypassed the skin and tore through the 10% infill.
* **The Takeaway:** Velocity gets you to the market, but material science keeps you there. I learned that **System Threat Assessment** is just as important as functional requirements.

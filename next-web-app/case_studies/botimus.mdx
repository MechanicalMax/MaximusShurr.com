### Product Strategy: The "Business Thinking"

This wasn't just a toy design class project; it was an exercise in **Extreme Constraints.**

Most students worked in teams of four over several weeks. I worked alone, with only three days on the clock. My strategy was **"Parallel Execution."** I couldn't afford the traditional "Design -> Build -> Test" waterfall. I had to design the electronics housing while the chassis was printing, and simulate the flipper physics in Python while the glue was drying.

This project was about calculating the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for combat. I used free-body diagrams to calculate the exact force needed to flip an opponent, ensuring I didn't waste a single gram of weight or amp of power on unnecessary features.

### The Problem

I faced a "David vs. Goliath" scenario on two fronts:

- **The Resource Gap:** I was a solo engineer competing against teams with 4x the manpower and weeks of lead time.

- **The Physics Constraint:** My bot was 3D printed (plastic). The competition included bots with metal saw blades. I needed to design a bot that could win through agility and leverage, not brute durability.

- **The Human Limit:** I had 72 hours to do 100 hours of work.

### The Build

I treated this as a 43-hour hackathon, combining every skill in my arsenal.

- **Simulation-Led Design:**

    - Before touching CAD, I used **Python** to run physics simulations on the flipper mechanism. I calculated torque requirements and lever arm lengths to ensure the flipper would actually work under load.

    - I used these calculations to drive the **SolidWorks** design, adhering to "Form Follows Function."

- **Rapid Manufacturing:**

    - I optimized my print settings for speed without sacrificing structural integrity, using the 3D printer as a "force multiplier" that ran while I slept (or tried to... it’s a studio apartment).

    - I integrated **IoT electronics** for remote control, creating a custom responsive drive system.

### The Outcome

The result was a mix of triumph, disaster, and profound learning.

- **The Victory:** Despite the odds, **I won my section**, defeating teams that had spent weeks on their builds. My "simulation-first" approach paid off in the arena.

- **The Defeat:** In the finals, reality caught up. A metal-blade bot tore Botimus to pieces.

- **The Human Lesson:** I was so "locked in" that I missed a virtual exam for another class. It was a wake-up call that **velocity has a cost**. I learned that true success isn't just about the product you build, but maintaining the balance required to keep building tomorrow.

- **The "Why":** Botimus is gone, but the feeling remains. I proved to myself that when I give 100%, I can out-build teams and out-think constraints. It was the most "alive" I have ever felt as an engineer.

### Product Strategy: The "Business Thinking"

Great opportunities often disguise themselves as mundane moments. I was sitting in a barber chair getting a haircut when I noticed the owner struggling to set up a new Point of Sale (POS) system. The business was running on pen and paper, and the transition to digital was stalling because the team wasn't comfortable with the technology.

My strategy was **"Accessible Modernization."** I didn't try to sell them a complex, over-engineered React app. I pitched a solution that solved their immediate pain point: a simple, reliable web presence and the training to use it.

I realized that **technical empathy** is just as important as technical skill. The goal wasn't just to build a website; it was to give the owner the confidence to operate a modern business. I leveraged a simple stack (HTML/CSS hosted on GitHub Pages) to ensure zero maintenance costs and maximum reliability for the client.

### The Problem

Henni's Hairshop was a beloved local staple, but its operations were stuck in the past.

- **The Analog Bottleneck:** Scheduling was done entirely by pen and paper, leading to inefficiencies and lost data.

- **The "Tech Gap":** The owner had purchased modern POS software but lacked the technical familiarity to implement it (struggling with account creation and passwords).

- **Invisible Online:** Without a website, new customers couldn't find them or book appointments easily.

### The Build

I acted as a **Digital Consultant**, handling everything from code to coaching in a one-week sprint.

- **Rapid Development:**

    - I built a custom, responsive website using **HTML and CSS**. I chose this "back-to-basics" stack to ensure the site was lightning fast and easy to host for free on **GitHub Pages**.

    - I focused on security and style, delivering a seamless custom site that enhanced the brand without bloating the budget.

- **The Human Element:**

    - I didn't just hand over the keys. I spent time training the staff on how to use the new booking software, turning a source of anxiety into a tool for growth.

    - I helped configure the shop's operational procedures to match the new digital workflow.

### The Outcome

I turned a routine haircut into a business transformation.

- **Operational Velocity:** The shop now accepts online bookings, reducing phone tag and administrative overhead.

- **Empowered Owners:** The staff transitioned from fearing the new technology to using it confidently every day.

- **The "Founder's Lesson":** I learned that the hardest part of business isn't the code—it's having the courage to speak up. By asking a simple question—"Would you like some help?"—I created value for a local business and proved that **opportunity is everywhere if you're willing to solve problems.**

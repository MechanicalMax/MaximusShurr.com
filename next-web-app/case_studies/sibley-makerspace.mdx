### Product Strategy: The "Business Thinking"

My summer at the Sibley Center was defined by a single mission: **Sustainability through Simplification.**

Whether I was working with a startup founder or a middle school student, the goal was the same: take a complex, overwhelming problem and break it down into something achievable.

For the startup client, this meant "Design for Manufacturing" (DFM)—stripping away the excess to find the commercially viable core of the product. For the students, it meant "Design for Confidence"—stripping away the intimidation of STEM to reveal the joy and wonder of building. I didn't just want to teach a camp; I wanted to establish a business model and curriculum that would allow the Sibley Center to continue this impact long after my internship ended.

### The Problem

I was tasked with solving two distinct challenges on opposite ends of the engineering spectrum:

- **The Manufacturing Bottleneck:** A local founder had a novel idea for a fishing rod caddy, but the design was bloated. It was too expensive to manufacture and too complex to assemble, trapping the product in "prototype purgatory."

- **The Opportunity Gap:** Students from local below-poverty-line schools (low income) had virtually no exposure to robotics or coding. They didn't see themselves as "builders" because they had never been given the tools or the permission to try.

### The Build

As a TechPoint XTern, I served as both a **Lead Engineer** and a **Program Director**.

- **Engineering the Product:**

    - I partnered with the client to analyze their fishing rod caddy. I didn't just "fix" the CAD; I reimagined the assembly.

    - I achieved an **80% reduction in the Bill of Materials (BOM)** part count, transforming a complex assembly into a sleek, manufacturable product.

    - I helped secure proper IP protection, turning a garage prototype into a venture-ready asset.

- **Engineering the Experience:**

    - I developed a six-day VEX Robotics curriculum that takes students from "zero to robot" without technical jargon.

    - I overhauled the Sibley Center's website and recorded instructional videos, creating a digital infrastructure to support future camps.

    - I facilitated connections between local robotics teams and school leadership to improve funding allocation, ensuring the impact scaled beyond just my classroom.

### The Outcome

This experience reinforced my belief that engineering is a tool for empowerment.

- **Commercial Viability:** The client's product moved from a complex concept to a manufacturable reality with a clear path to market.

- **Sparking the Fire:** I saw students' eyes light up as their code turned into motion for the first time. Giving back to a community less fortunate than my own was a profound reminder of *why* I build.

- **The Network Effect:** Through the XTern program, I connected with over 100 peers and industry pros. It taught me that there is no single "right way" to be an engineer—only the way that allows you to live a life true to your own values.

### Product Strategy: The "Business Thinking"

My time at LeafSpec was my first bridge between the theoretical world of PhD research and the practical reality of commercial agriculture. The technology—a hyperspectral scanner that could detect plant disease in seconds—was brilliant. But brilliant tech doesn't automatically become a successful product.

My strategy was **Adaptability First.** In the lab, variables are controlled. In a cornfield, nothing is controlled. Leaves vary in size, shape, and fragility. My role was to redesign the hardware so it could survive and function in the chaotic real world, transforming a delicate lab instrument into a robust tool for farmers.

### The Problem

We faced a classic "Lab-to-Field" gap:

- **The Biological Constraint:** Nature doesn't follow CAD drawings. Corn leaves change dramatically from stem to tip. The existing rigid clamping mechanism risked damaging the very plants we were trying to save.

- **The Robotic Constraint:** While a human hand can easily adjust to a fragile leaf, the robotic arm in Purdue's automated greenhouse lacked that tactile nuance. We needed a mechanism that offered the dexterity of a human hand with the clearance and durability required for automation.

- **The Manufacturing Bottleneck:** The existing handheld scanner designs were complex and time-consuming to assemble, making mass production difficult.

### The Build

I worked as a **Product R&D Intern**, collaborating directly with PhDs and graduate researchers.

- **Engineering the Clamp:**

    - I led the brainstorming and prototyping process for a new clamping mechanism.

    - I designed and 3D-printed a **4-bar linkage system** that could adapt to the variable thickness of corn leaves without crushing them. This mechanical "soft touch" was critical for the robot's success.

- **Optimizing for Production:**

    - I redesigned the handheld scanner casing in **SolidWorks**, focusing on "Design for Assembly" principles.

    - My new design **reduced assembly time by 25%** and simplified the Bill of Materials (BOM), making the device cheaper and faster to manufacture.

- **Validating the Market:**

    - I didn't just stay in the lab. I flew to **Cornell University** and the **GrowNY** summit to conduct on-the-ground market research.

    - I interviewed farmers and met with startup incubators to understand the economic value of our data, ensuring our engineering efforts aligned with what growers actually needed.

### The Outcome

This project was a masterclass in interdisciplinary collaboration.

- **Operational Success:** My adaptive clamping mechanism is now in active use at **Purdue’s Ag Alumni Seed Phenotyping Facility (AAPF)**, enabling high-throughput scanning that was previously impossible.

- **Data Impact:** By enabling higher quality scans, we helped researchers gain deeper insights into how fertilizers and pesticides affect plant growth, directly contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices.

- **The "Why" realized:** Speaking with U.S. Senators and local farmers showed me that engineering isn't just about the device; it's about the food system and the people who rely on it. This experience solidified my commitment to building technology that solves fundamental human needs.
